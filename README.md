* There are 94 Vine program reviews; there are 40471 unpaid reviews.
* There are 48 Vine program five star reviews; there are 15663 unpaid five star reviews.
* Five star reviews make up 51.1% of the Vine reviews; five star reviews make up 38.7% of the unpaid reviews.

## Summary

* There appears to be a bias of higher reviews towards the Vine program. This is supported by 51.1% of the Vine reviews being five star reviews, while only 38.7% of the unpaid reviews being five star reviews.
* As an additional test to support the positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program, a two-sample t-test could be conducted to determine whether there is a statistical difference between the means of the Vine and non-Vine review samples.
